                where he would eventually pull much of the inspiration of Farmhouse Thai Kitchen from. 
                Some of Kasem’s best days were back from his childhood, where he would run around the streets 
                of Northern Thailand eating street food and learning from the monk’s on the values of life. 
                He studied computer science and graduated with a computer science degree back in Thailand, which 
                came in handy in the future as he would pay attention and utilize technology in marketing 
                Farmhouse and putting Farmhouse on the map.`

He went door to door looking for a job, but he didn’t have any experience working in the U.S. Finally, he found one for $5/hr cleaning the yard for people in the community.

That was his very first experience working in the food business. Meanwhile, he continued his studies at his community college for computer science.`,

He was so committed to his role that his customers would wait for him to get off work just to give him a personal tip.
