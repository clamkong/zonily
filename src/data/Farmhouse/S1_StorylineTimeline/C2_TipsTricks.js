As a manager, he was making great income, over $10,000 a month at Osha Thai, and it was a great opportunity for him at his age, background, and experience.

Kasem stayed angry at this person for a long time and blamed him for not understanding what it too to grow the restaurant business. He only cared about his goals and not the employees."

He realized that it was himself that forgot to breathe and he wasn’t receiving enough oxygen to his brain because of that. At that moment he realized that he was under so much pressure and not happy with his life. He realized that he has changed into a different person, and selfish and lonely person, and decided to change."
