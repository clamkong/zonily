        Back when Chef Kasem was working at Grand Pubar, he was working on the roof in the cold and he was pressed to sell a very expensive wine ($1,000) in order to hit his goal.
        He went to other restaurants and ordered the wine himself, observed how they served it, what is their motions, explanation, and process. He then went to the sommelier to learn the history and story of the wine and winery.
        He was able to sell the wine successfully.
