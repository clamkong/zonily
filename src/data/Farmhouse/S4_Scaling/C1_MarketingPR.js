Housing prices doubled in 2 years so many previous residents moved out of the city and many new technology employees moved into San Francisco. For the restaurant business (Chef Kasem) predicted accurately that they will all be using online resources to find out where to go to eat. Therefore social media, google SEO, etc. became critical in growth. The new technology age group is 25-60 which is also the same target age range as Farmhouse."
